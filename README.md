## Reconstruct_Image_data_using_PSK_modulation

#### Project Purpose
- To understand the process of BPSK modulation & demodulation
- To analyze differences between original image and restored image

#### Project Procedure
- Load image & image parameters settings
- plot the original image
- image vectorization
- image binarize(decimal to binary)
- bit vectorization
- BPSK modulation & demodulation
- Reconstruct image file

#### Result
- Original


- Restored Image
